# Open discussion 

### Expected learning outcome for participants: Users discuss how to implement deep learning analyses in their own research.

## 1. Theoretical considerations
   * What are the ways you could apply deep learning to your study system?
   * What are the theoretical opportunities and challenges?
   * What do you envision as opportunities and challenges for others using these methods in fields that are different from your own?	


## 2. Practical considerations

   * What are the methodological challenges and opportunities for implementing deep learning for your study system?
   * How do you envision using these methods for specimens in the field (as opposed to herbarium sheets)?


## 3. Future directions

  * How could we use 3D data in these types of analyses?
  * How could we incorporate species interactions?

#Case Studies: How are researchers using deep learning?

##Examples Using Herbarium Specimens

 

##Digitization of natural history specimens

            in US:  iDigBio

                        >128 M records

                        >40M media records

 

##Herbarium specimens

            400,000,000 worldwide in 3400 herbaria

            In iDigBio, >30M images of specimens

            Excellent resource for many types of research
